# Planet Vacation
## A site to help you decide which planet to visit.

### How it works.
 Each planet is assigned a value on a scale of one to nine.
 The answer for each question is assigned a numeric weight,
 from one to nine. If there are fewer than nine answers, the
 values for that question are evenly distributed across this range.
 For example, a question with three answers would have the values 2,5,7.
 (3,6,9 would have a higher range prejudice, but 1,3,6,9 works for four
  answers.)

### Planet values
  Planets were roughly ordered very arbitrarily from most friendly (1, Earth)
  to least hospitable (9, Pluto). I consider Pluto a planet for this site even
  though it isn't. So sue me. Complete order as follows:
*  1-Earth
*  2-Mars
*  3-Saturn (Moons)
*  4-Jupiter (Moons)
*  5-Venus
*  6-Mercury
*  7-Neptune
*  8-Uranus
*  9-Pluto

The total number of points are divided by nine, and nine equal ranges within
the total possible point to reach a final answer.
